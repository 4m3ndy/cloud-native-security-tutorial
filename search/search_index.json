We\u2019ll start with possible attack vectors, to help you map out the threat model that applies to your cluster, so you can figure out where you need to focus your efforts for security. We\u2019ll show you how to compromise a deployment with a pod running with a known vulnerability. Once you\u2019ve had the attacker\u2019s eye-view, we\u2019ll walk you through the most important techniques and open source tools to prevent compromise.
